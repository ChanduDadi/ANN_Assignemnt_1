In this task you shall implement your own forward and backward steps for linear and relu functions and layers.
You will work with jupyter notebooks in this folder.
The notebooks will guide you through and you will implement functions and classes in the python scripts in the ann_code folder.

All the work had done in pytorch. You do not need to import any other libraries (no need for numpy etc.)
1) Begin with linear_regression.ipynb
2) Follow with feed_forward_net.ipynb
