ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
In this project, I implemented custom forward and backward passes for both Linear and ReLU functions and layers using PyTorch only â€” without relying on high-level APIs or any external libraries such as NumPy.

I followed a notebook-driven approach to build and test each component step-by-step.

ðŸ›  Completed Workflow
Worked through the Jupyter notebooks located in the notebooks/ folder.

Followed detailed instructions provided in:

linear_regression.ipynb

feed_forward_net.ipynb

Implemented all required classes and functions manually in the Python scripts under the ann_code/ folder.

Focused exclusively on PyTorch for all operations (no NumPy or other libraries used).

Successfully created a functioning feedforward neural network with manual forward and backward computation.
